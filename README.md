<h2>üßê Features</h2>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- Scalable Messaging: Utilizes Kafka for message handling and Redis Streams for inter-server communication ensuring optimal throughput even under heavy loads. The system dynamically scales to accommodate increasing message traffic.
- Efficient Load Balancing: Employs Redis Streams for inter-server communication enabling load balancing and seamless message routing across horizontally scaled server instances.
- Microservices Architecture: Containerized backend services including Kafka Redis Zookeeper and PostgreSQL using Docker for enhanced modularity and scalability. Each service operates independently facilitating easier management and deployment.
- Responsive Frontend: Developed a React.js UI with WebSocket connections for efficient communication with the backend ensuring a smooth user experience. The frontend is designed to be responsive and intuitive providing users with a seamless chat interface across devices.
